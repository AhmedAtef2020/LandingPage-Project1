## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

I add some global variables at start

Then there is a loop over all sections, create "list element", then create "a" link element.
add both elements to a fragment element, then add it after loop as Child to nav tag (nav part)
also create the smooth scroll inside this loop to applay for each element in sections.

And finally, using onscroll funcion with loops over sections and by using the bounds of section (top and bottom) and add or remove class of active for both navbar and sections backgrounds
